# Class DAO Project - Dauphine 24 Digital Economics

The Role of this Decentralised Autonomous Organisation is to roleplay as a governance system for our version of a Model UN focused on funding/policy proposals that solve Climate Change.

Our Working is split between the Token team and Governance team. 

The token team has selected ERC 777 as the token of choice - with token transfer, token voting, and vote delegation.
The governance team has selected XXX for YYY as its governance control process. 
You can follow their branches for updates.
