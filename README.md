Our DAO project, dubbed ClimateDAO, aims to simulate climate voting within the United Nations, akin to the Conference of the Parties (COP).

The COP serves as the primary decision-making body for both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Its primary responsibility involves reviewing the national communications and emission inventories submitted by member Parties. Using this data, the COP evaluates the efficacy of the measures implemented by Parties and the progress towards achieving the Convention's ultimate objective.

The COP convenes annually, unless otherwise determined by the Parties.

It's crucial to note that agreements reached during COP are not legally binding, nor are Parties subject to sanctions for non-compliance.

In our approach, while we emulate aspects of COP, we introduce modifications to the voting system. These modifications are framed by incentives designed to promote the realization of agreed-upon objectives or to encourage participants to consider the long-term implications before engaging solely for short-term political gains, knowing that they will not face sanctions.

In our framework and similar to what happens in the COP we assume that there is a technical committee, with the necessary expertise in climate change, that draft proposals with the necessary objectives we need to accomplish in order to maintain the long term sustainability of the planet, taking into account socio-economic status of each member. 

For example, if the technical committee reaches the conclusion that we need to limit the total emission of CO2 to 500 units by 2040 reparted differently by country this is the objective that will reach COP for discussion and voting. In this case if the c

Let's imagine the technical committee will send 15 drafts of objectives needed to grant sustainability.

In this case for voting purposes each country will be given a total of 100 tokens to vote on all 15 subjects.

Of course the technical committee draft will be subject to negotiations, to which extent each country will contribute to this objective. So each representantive will be allowed to propose changes to the draft. Those propositions will be delivered to the technical committee which will evaluate the pertinance. If there is a favourable opinion of the committee the proposal is submitted to votation otherwise it is not submitted.

To promote quality among propositions if a country or a group of countries proposal is ratified each country of the proposition group is rewarded with 10 tokens 

ClimateDAO breakdown:

- Quadratic voting : If someone want to cast 1 vote it will cost 1 token, 2 votes cost 4 tokens, 3 votes costs 9 tokens...; 
- TimeLock: when a new proposal is submitted to voting there is a block of 24h that need to pass before voting. ;
- Technical committee can submit drafts of resolutions that in general require a simple majority quorum, except if it calls for economic sanctions and in this case the necessary quorum is 2/3.

# Class DAO Project - Dauphine 24 Digital Economics

The Role of this Decentralised Autonomous Organisation is to roleplay as a governance system for our version of a Model UN focused on funding/policy proposals that solve Climate Change.

Our Working is split between the Token team and Governance team. 

The token team has selected ERC 777 as the token of choice - with token transfer, token voting, and vote delegation.
The governance team has selected XXX for YYY as its governance control process. 
You can follow their branches for updates.
